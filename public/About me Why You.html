<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have the desire to learn everything I can in this lifetime. In my opinion, time is our most valuable asset.
Over the years I've accumulated a vast amount of hobbies and skills. A true hobbiest. If it involves sports, food, video, technology or travel, I've most likely dabbled in it.

<h1>Why Me?</h1>
<p>Communication is my #1 skill. When it comes to getting everyone on the same page, conflict resolution, learning and growing, and properly training people, I'm your girl. I take my work seriously, but I'm also the fun one.</p>
<h1>Why Should I Choose You?</h1>

You're proud about the people and culture that's been created and consistently maintain a safe place for people to bring their authentic selves to work. You advocate for personal growth and have clear ways for people to go up or move around in the company. You understand work life balance and take that seriously.You walk the talk you spew. :)</p>
