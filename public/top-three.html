<h1>Charlie's Top 3 Activities</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Activities</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ice Skating</h3>
<p>I grew up on the ice. Gliding feels more natural than walking. If I could skate everywhere, I would.</p>
<h3>Taking Udemy courses</h3>
<p>I have built so many valuable skillsets in shorter amounts of time from masters of the craft. I love learning and it's a blast to find new things to dive into.</p>
<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>I'm one to pick up and put things down quick if they can't hold my attention. Coding challenges me in the way I LOVE. My brain naturally craves solving and strategizing. When I started coding it was like finding a treasure. I thoroughly enjoy the process and failing my way to understanding.</p>
